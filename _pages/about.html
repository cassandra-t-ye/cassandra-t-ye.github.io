I’m broadly interested in <strong>computer vision</strong> and <strong>computational imaging methods</strong> for <strong>biological applications</strong>. Recently, I’ve been doing some work in <strong>uncertainty quantification</strong>!</p> <p>In a past life, I was an undergraduate at MIT studying Computer Science and Engineering. During my time there, I worked at the <a href="https://yougroup.mit.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Computational Biophotonics Lab</a> headed by <a href="https://sixianyou.mit.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sixian You</a>, working on optimizing computational algorithms for microscopy image reconstruction <img class="emoji" title=":test_tube:" alt=":test_tube:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f9ea.png" height="20" width="20"><img class="emoji" title=":dna:" alt=":dna:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f9ec.png" height="20" width="20"><img class="emoji" title=":microscope:" alt=":microscope:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f52c.png" height="20" width="20"></p> <p>If you’re interested in collaborating or have any questions about my work at all, please don’t hesitate to reach out!</p> </body></html>
