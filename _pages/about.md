Hi, I'm Cassandra, and I'm currently a 1st year Computer Science Ph.D student at Cornell University where I'm advised by [Kristina Monakhova](https://kristinamonakhova.com/). I'm broadly interested in **computer vision** and **computational imaging methods** for **biological applications**. Recently, I've been doing some work in **uncertainty quantification**!

In a past life, I was an undergraduate at MIT studying Computer Science and Engineering. During my time there, I worked at the [Computational Biophotonics Lab](https://yougroup.mit.edu/) headed by [Sixian You](https://sixianyou.mit.edu/), working on optimizing computational algorithms for microscopy image reconstruction :test_tube::dna::microscope:

If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions about my work at all, please don't hesitate to reach out!
